# ML_App
Welcome to my ML app! This application allows you to apply regression or classification algorithms to a CSV file of your choice. You can also save your machine learning model based on the best evaluation metrics.

Getting Started
To get started with the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running: 
pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Prepare your CSV file by placing it in the same directory as the app.
4. Launch the app by running:
streamlit run app.py in your terminal.

Usage
1. Once the app is running, you will see a file uploader where you can select your CSV file.
2. After uploading the file, you will be presented with options to choose between regression or classification algorithms.
3. Select the desired algorithm and click on the "Apply" button.
4. The app will process the data and display the evaluation metrics for the chosen algorithm.
5. If you are satisfied with the results, you can choose to save the trained model by clicking on the "Save Model" button.

Feel free to explore and customize this app to suit your needs. Happy machine learning!
